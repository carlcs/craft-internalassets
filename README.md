# Internal Assets plugin for Craft CMS 3.x

A simple plugin to restrict access to assets for permitted users only. Access to a given asset is only granted if the user has view-permissions for the given source (this can be set in the user- or group-settings).

The asset source folder should be moved out of the web root folder so the files are never accessible without this plugin.

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0-beta.23 or later.
